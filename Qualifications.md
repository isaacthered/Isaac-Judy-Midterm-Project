# Qualifications

Theodosia's character and experience would make her an excellent candidate for any programming position:
 * She has a flexible schedule, and is able to adapt her sleeping hours for any contingency.
 * She has a proven track record when it comes to effectively communicating problems to her teammates, having developed a novel meowing strategy she has used throughout her previous positions.
 * She has over 5 years of experience with eliminating bugs. Achievements include removing the entire cricket population at both of her places of residence and confirmed kills of several moths.
    * **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Theodosia will not take any position that involves removing spiders. She would never attack another huntress, especially one with such a beautiful technique.
 * Relatedly, she would be eager to help coordinate the development of any spiders a search engine company might need. 
 * She hones her computer science skills on a daily basis, as seen in the below image:

 Here is an example of her coding technique:
 
    function eat(testedFunction, testValue, expectedValue) {
       if (testedFunction(testValue)===expectedValue) {
          return testedFunction;
       } else {
          return "";
       };
    };
    //the below scenario assumes the function variables are not constants
    exampleFunction=eat(exampleFunction, varA, varB);
    //most problems can be solved by eating them
