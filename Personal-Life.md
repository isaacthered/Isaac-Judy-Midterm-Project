# Personal Life

Theodosia Raincloud Purr spent her first months learning to hunt on the streets. After becoming trapped in the wheelwell of a car, the humans across the street were so 
impressed by her perserverence through the difficult situation that they immediately hired her to teach them the proper social skills so many humans tragically never

inspired her to begin broadening her horizons and seek a position that actually gives her adequate payment.
